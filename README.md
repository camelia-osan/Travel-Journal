# Travel Journal
Frontend Development, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React


### Description
A small travel journal web app built with React. The app displays travel destinations dynamically using reusable components and a structured data file. Itâ€™s responsive across different screen sizes, thanks to Flexbox and media queries.

This project demonstrates the use of reusable React components, mapping through data and responsive design. It is inspired by a [Scrimba React course](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e) I completed.


### Features
* Reusable components for travel cards, icons and other UI elements. Easily extensible.
* Dynamically renders travel destinations from a centralized data file (*data.js*).
* Each card displays: an image, location (name and country), link to Google Maps, activity suggestion and a text description.
* Responsive layout for mobile, tablets and desktop.


### Tools
* CSS & Flexbox - styling and layout
* React - reusable functional components
